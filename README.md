[World Edit](https://github.com/Uberi/Minetest-WorldEdit) 

This pack is currently up-to-date with Minetest Game and supports nearly 100% of its textures. The original pack had wrong/outdated file names or missing textures. The textures themselves have been the least modified as possible for not alterating the artwork of Gambit.
